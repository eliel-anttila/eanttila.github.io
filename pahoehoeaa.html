								<p>Lava flows pose a direct threat to communities, so researchers have studied their flow characteristics thoroughly. Here, we investigate why certain lava flows may change in their flow characteristics. We plan to build numerical models to better investigate flow transitions. </p>

                                        The Yih Instability in Layered Lava Flow May Initiate the Pāhoehoe to ‘a‘ā Lava Transition

                                    <p> Most lavas begin to flow as a ropy lava called pāhoehoe that can suddenly transition into ‘a‘ā, a clunkery and crystal-rich lava. Although it has a high viscosity, ‘a‘ā appears to be fast flowing, which is counter intuitive. We propose a model to explain the mechanism that triggers the transition. Field observations of cooled pāhoehoe lava suggest that pāhoehoe lava may have internal layers. The differences in flow speeds between the layers may trigger rapid mixing, which is more likely to happen in fast flowing lavas. This rapid mixing would lead to cooling, thus crystal formation of the lava flow. We suggest that this process may be the reason why ‘a‘ā transition may be associated with fast flows. </p>
