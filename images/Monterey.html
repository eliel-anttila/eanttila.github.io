								<p>Understanding the transfer of carbon between Earth’s surface reservoirs is necessary for interpreting
                                    climate transitions in Earth history and predicting future climate change. Warming associated with
                                    the 16.9–14.7 Ma Miocene Climate Optimum and subsequent cooling during the 14.7–13.8 Ma Middle
                                    Miocene Climate Transition provide opportunities to study carbon cycle dynamics in the geologically
                                    recent past. The Monterey Hypothesis interprets the Middle Miocene Climate Transition cooling as part
                                    of a positive feedback in which enhanced organic carbon burial on the eastern Pacific margin drew
                                    down atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. This idea has been supported by the correlation of organic-rich deposits in the
                                    Monterey Formation in coastal California with the mid-Miocene Monterey Event, a globally-observed
                                    positive shift in the δ<sup>13</sup>C of marine carbonates that may be indicative of elevated burial of δ<sup>13</sup>C-
                                    depleted organic carbon.

									<strong>
									Constraining the timing and tempo of organic carbon burial in the Monterey Formation
									</strong>
									We use 31 new U-Pb zircon laser ablation inductively coupled plasma
                                    mass spectrometry ages and 14 new isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry ages from
                                    volcanic ash beds in the Monterey Formation along the Santa Barbara coast to constrain the timing
                                    and tempo of organic carbon mass accumulation in some of the most organic-rich rocks in California. </p>

								    The new age model for the northern Santa Barbara Basin sections reveals that peaks in organic carbon mass accumulation rate (panel A, at right) in the Monterey
                                    Formation do not coincide with the Monterey Event(panel B), or changes in proxies for global climate (panels B and C, at right). Furthermore, total organic carbon content in the Miocene
                                    Santa Barbara Basin is inversely correlated with sedimentation rate: high-TOC portions of the stratigraphy typicall have low sedimentation rates, resulting in moderate to low carbon mass accumulation rates, despite elevated total organic carbon content. We propose a model in which changes in organic
                                    carbon burial rates in the Monterey Formation were driven by a combination of sea-level change (modeled global eustaasy is depicted in panel D, at right) and
                                    local tectonically-mediated basin formation, which provided first-order controls on sedimentation rate. Thus, organic carbon burial in the Monterey Formation is better described as a response to, rather than a driver of, global climate.</p>
